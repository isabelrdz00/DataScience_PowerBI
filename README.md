# PowerBIDataScience_project
### Project Overview
This project is a Power BI dashboard created to visualize and analyze a survey conducted among data professionals. The dataset includes various demographic details, job titles, salary ranges, and respondents' satisfaction with their job and work-life balance. The purpose of this project is to gain insights into the field of data analytics by breaking down survey results into interactive visualizations and presenting findings in an easily digestible format.

## Key Objectives
#### Data Transformation & Preparation:

- Import raw data collected from a survey.
- Transform the data using Power BI's Power Query Editor.
- Perform data cleaning and standardization for key variables such as job titles and programming languages.
- Calculate average salaries and other aggregated metrics for meaningful comparisons.

### Interactive Dashboard Visualizations:

- **Tree Map** to display the distribution of survey respondents by country.
- **Bar Chart** to showcase the average salary by job title.
- **Stacked Bar Chart** for analyzing the favorite programming languages by different job titles.
- **Donut Chart** to compare average salary by gender.
- **Gauge Charts** to reflect satisfaction with work-life balance and salary.
- **KPIs (Cards)** for key figures like the average age of survey respondents and the total count of respondents.
